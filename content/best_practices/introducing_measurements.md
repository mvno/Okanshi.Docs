Mindset is important when you introduce Okanshi into your code base. It is important not to go into "analysis paralysis".

We prefer to simply start using Okanshi where you first see a need for measurements. Perhaps in relation to a defect or other. Do not start by agreeing to a long list of cases and situations where monitoring is mandatory. Its a learning process and often case-by-case. No matter how hard you contemplate on where to do measurements, you will encounter situations where you are not measuring enough or in the right way.

Your mindset should be that it is not "the end of the world" when a measurement is missing. It is a "so what? Lets just insert that extra measurement and move on"-kind of thing.
